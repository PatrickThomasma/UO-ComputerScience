==============================
Final	30
Fails all tests and seg faults on the first two.
The code in convert for initializing csr_row_ptr is using the incorrect loop bound.
Also, the col_ind and vals are being copied directly - this will not work when the non-zero elements are not sorted in a specific manner.
